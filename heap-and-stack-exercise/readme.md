# Heap & Stack Example

This is an abstracted example of accessing the heap
and using a call stack. You'll be passing a list of coordinates
into a `main()` function that will be access the words in
the `heap.js` file and queue up an array that will be
printed by the provided `printer()` function. Each word/character
chosen will act is its own call on the stack.
